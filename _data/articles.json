      "title": "Diving practices in technical divers' community and behaviour towards self-reported unusual symptoms.",
      "abstract": "The use of gas mixtures containing helium for deep recreational diving is increasingly common, involving complex logistics and decision-making compromises. The characteristics and inherent risks of this practice remain poorly documented. This study aims to provide an epidemiological inventory of practices and diving-related incidents within the technical diving community.\nAn international online survey was disseminated on social networks targeting certified trimix divers. It collected demographic data, diving experience, and dive management practices, along with self-reported unusual symptoms, treatments, and outcomes following trimix dives.\nA total of 558 questionnaires were analysed, predominantly from males (92%), mostly over 46 years old (61%), with high certification levels and recreational diving purposes. Forty-two percent reported one or more medical risk factors related to diving. Rebreather use was prevalent (79% at least occasionally). Decompression was primarily managed using compartmental models (85%) with gradient-factors adjustment. Dive planning varied significantly among individuals. Gas density at depth frequently exceeded the current recommendations. Ten percent had experienced symptoms suggestive of gas toxicity, mainly related to nitrogen narcosis. Thirty-six percent (199/558) reported experiencing, at least once, symptoms of diving-related incidents, with 61% (n = 121/199) expressing certainty. In 48% (120/261) of incidents involving decompression sickness (DCS) or breathing symptoms, no treatment was initiated. Among episodes involving DCS symptoms (n = 254), 42% received normobaric oxygen, and 23% sought medical advice, while 16% were treated with hyperbaric oxygen. Only 2.5% reported probable long-lasting sequelae.\nThe diversity of practices highlights the lack of robust scientific data supporting them. The accident rate in mixed-gas diving may be higher than in typical scuba air diving, though mostly of mild severity. Treatment appears to be neglected despite divers' high knowledge levels. Continued research into decompression and the physiological effects of these dives is essential, along with ongoing awareness and education efforts in diving first aid within this exposed community.",

      "title": "Core outcome set for research in necrotising soft tissue infection patients: an international, multidisciplinary, modified Delphi consensus study.",
      "abstract": "Necrotising soft tissue infections (NSTI) are serious infections associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Heterogeneity of outcome reporting in the NSTI literature precludes the synthesis of high-quality evidence. There is substantial interest in studying the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen treatment as an adjunctive treatment in NSTI. The aim of this study was to develop a set of core outcome measures for future trials evaluating interventions for NSTI.\nA modified Delphi consensus method was used to conduct a three-round survey of a diverse panel of clinicians and researchers with expertise in NSTI, and patients with lived experience of NSTI. Participants rated the preliminary list of outcomes using a 9-point scale from 1 (least important) to 9 (most critical). The a priori definition of consensus required outcomes to be rated critical (score ≥ 7) by ≥ 70% of participants, and not important (score ≤ 3) by ≤ 15% of participants. After meeting consensus, outcomes were removed from subsequent rounds. Outcomes that did not meet consensus were included in subsequent rounds.\nNinety-eight participants from 14 countries registered and 86%, 69% and 57% responded for each round, respectively. Outcome measures quantifying five core areas achieved consensus: Death, surgical procedures of debridements and amputations, functional outcome among survivors, measures of sepsis, including septic shock and organ dysfunction and resource use measured through length of hospital and intensive care unit stay.\nThis initial core set of outcome measures will be evaluated and optimised and can harmonise outcome measurements for investigations among patients with NSTI.",

      "abstract": "Psychotic disorders, characterised by impaired reality testing and a spectrum of symptoms, present significant challenges in assessing fitness for diving. While diving can be a safe and rewarding activity, the unique physiological and environmental stresses of hyperbaric conditions can exacerbate psychotic vulnerability or mimic psychotic symptoms. This article reviews the literature on psychosis and diving, exploring the implications of psychotic disorders, psychotropic medications, and hyperbaric effects. It highlights the critical importance of illness insight, the absence of comorbid conditions, and complete remission in determining diving fitness. Key recommendations include avoiding deep dives, careful evaluation of medication use, and a nuanced differentiation between chronic and transient psychoses. By synthesizing existing evidence, this article aims to guide diving medicine professionals in making informed decisions about psychosis and diving suitability.",

      "title": "Effect of normobaric and hyperbaric hyperoxia treatment on symptoms and cognitive capacities in Long COVID patients: a randomised placebo-controlled, prospective, double-blind trial.",
      "abstract": "Long COVID syndrome is a major health issue. Multiple treatments have been proposed but efficacy is inadequately investigated. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been promoted based on a small number of publications. As there is potential for a placebo effect and the financial cost of HBOT is high, we sought to investigate the effects of HBOT in Long COVID in a randomised trial.\nWe randomised 101 patients into four treatment groups, receiving 10 sessions of oxygen 'treatment' inside a pressure chamber, according to one of four modalities: A - 100% oxygen at 253 kPa (2.5 atmospheres absolute); B - 40% oxygen at 253 kPa; C - 100% oxygen at 101.3 kPa (1 atmosphere absolute); D - 21% oxygen at 101.3 kPa. Groups B and C thus received a similar effective oxygen dose of 101.3 kPa. Quality of life symptom scores (Visual Analogue Scale; EQ-5D-5L, C19-YRSm), a 6-minute walking test and five neurocognitive tests were administered before and after the treatment series. At three months post-treatment, a telephone questionnaire probed for lasting effects.\nAll groups were comparable with regards to demographics, Long COVID symptoms and severity. After treatment, there were no significant differences in subjective symptoms, functional scores, and cognitive performance between any groups. The response to treatment was highly variable, with some patients in even the 'placebo' group D reporting a significant improvement in their well-being. This was not reflected in any objective outcome scores. No subgroups of patients responded better to any of the treatments.\nThere was no significant effect from different doses of oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber. It is possible that the very modest improvements reported in other studies were due to a placebo effect. Claims that HBOT has a significant effect on Long COVID need further investigation before indiscriminately prescribing or promoting HBOT.",

      "abstract": "The ultrashort-acting properties and organ-independent metabolism of remifentanil may be advantageous in mechanical ventilation management. Unlike fentanyl, which accumulates over time and may prolong sedation, remifentanil enables more predictable titration and rapid weaning. This study aimed to determine the effect of remifentanil on shortening the duration of mechanical ventilation in comparison with fentanyl in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted, including randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies from MEDLINE, Cochrane, EMBASE, ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov, from inception to July 2024. Studies comparing remifentanil with fentanyl in mechanically ventilated ICU patients were included, whereas those that used only remifentanil or fentanyl intraoperatively were excluded. The primary outcome was ventilation duration, with a minimal important difference (MID) of 90 min. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed and the certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. The risk of bias was evaluated using RoB 2.0 and ROBINS-I tools.\nWe included 18 studies (14 RCTs and 4 observational studies). Ten studies (8 RCTs and 2 observational studies; 901 patients) were analysed. Remifentanil may reduce ventilation duration compared to fentanyl (8 RCTs: MD -6.70 h, 95% CI -14.36 to 0.97; low certainty; 2 observational studies: MD -21.26 h, 95% CI -37.29 to -5.24; low certainty).\nRemifentanil may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation, potentially improving patient outcomes. However, owing to the low certainty of the evidence and study heterogeneity, further high-quality RCTs are required to validate these findings.\nPROSPERO 2024 and CRD42024557414.",

      "title": "Vascular (dys)function in the failing heart.",
      "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is not confined to contractile failure of cardiomyocytes or myocardial fibrosis. Coronary and systemic vascular dysfunction contributes to the initiation and progression of HF with or without reduced ejection fraction. Furthermore, HF compromises vascular function, creating and sustaining a vicious cycle with deranging effects on coronary blood flow, cardiac metabolism and cardiac function. In HF, systemic arterial dysfunction, characterized by increased arterial stiffness and resistance, raises cardiac afterload and impedes myocardial contractile function. Reduced coronary blood flow impairs myocardial oxygen delivery and consequently cardiomyocyte metabolism and function. Coronary microvascular dysfunction is heterogeneous in its pathogenesis and manifestations, complicating the diagnosis and management across different HF phenotypes. Understanding the alterations in function in different segments of the vasculature, from the aorta to the capillary level, offers mechanistic insights into disease drivers and therapeutic interventions. Interventional approaches can improve vascular haemodynamics, whereas established and emerging pharmacotherapies target the neurohumoral axis and reduce extravascular compression, inflammation, and oxidative stress, thereby improving vascular function and HF-related outcomes. In this Review, we provide a mechanistic framework of vascular dysfunction in the pathogenesis of HF with or without reduced ejection fraction, pointing towards integrated therapies that consider the vascular implications of contemporary HF management across HF phenotypes.",

      "abstract": "Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) for colon cancer is technically challenging for novice surgeons. Although it has been shown to be safe and feasible, the learning curve (LC) among novices has not been characterized. The present study investigated the LC for SILS based on data from several novice surgeons.\nWe retrospectively reviewed consecutive cases of SILS-ileocecal resection (SILS-ICR) performed by two experienced and three novice surgeons from May 2009 to March 2020. A cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis was used to analyze the learning curve and evaluate SILS completion. In addition, a statistical model was created to clarify the difference between the operation times of novices (Surgeons C, D, and E) and experienced surgeons (Surgeons A and B), estimating the operative time and risk estimation model.\nTwo experienced surgeons and three novice surgeons performed 187 and 103 SILS-ICRs, respectively. A CUSUM analysis showed LCs of 20, 18, and 20 cases for Surgeons C, D, and E, respectively, suggesting that novice surgeons would achieve results comparable to those of experienced surgeons in 39, 47, and 36 cases, respectively.\nIn SILS-ICR, novice surgeons reached the nadir in 18-20 cases and reached the level of experienced surgeons in 36-47 cases.",

      "title": "The role of intersectionality in shaping participant engagement with health research through digital methods: findings from a qualitative study.",
      "abstract": "Digital research methods were rapidly adopted into clinical trials and health research during the COVID pandemic in 2020. Current UK policy aims to make digital research methods a norm, but their influence on recruitment, retention, and representation in health research remains largely unknown. Whilst efforts have been made to improve engagement with digital health interventions, less attention has been given to digital research methods-such as informed consent, data collection, and research communications-despite their potential to influence study participation and participant experience.\nThis qualitative study aims to understand the factors influencing the initial uptake and ongoing engagement with digital research methods across diverse populations, capturing experiences and perspectives to inform diverse and efficient health research conduct.\nSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 50 people who had participated in health research in the past 12 months. Reflective thematic analysis was used to understand factors influencing study engagement from participant perspectives, acknowledging the role of the researcher in data interpretation.\nThree interconnected themes were identified: (1) Digital Positionality: The Interplay of Social Position, Personal Experience, and Identity; (2) Power Redistribution in Research Relationships: Navigating Vulnerability and Agency; (3) Trust Assemblages: How Intersecting Identities Shape Multi-modal Verification Practices in Research Engagement. These themes illustrate how intersecting identity factors and social contexts shape engagement with digital methods in health research. The first theme revealed how factors such as age, social role, migration, and socioeconomic status create pathways towards or away from engagement with digital methods. The second theme highlights how different digital methods can shift power dynamics in participant-research relationships or expose social vulnerabilities. The third theme uncovered the complex ways participants established trust in research, relying on multi-channel trust makers.\nThe study reveals intersecting factors shaping participant engagement with digital methods, offering insights to enhance research conduct and increase diversity in health research participation. Future studies should integrate theoretical frameworks to examine these influencers and develop effective approaches for optimising diverse engagement with digital methods.",

      "abstract": "Conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) is a public health issue affecting thousands of survivors and with long-term consequences; however, it is underreported and difficult to investigate. This systematic review, covering 2015 to 2024, will explore sexual violence in conflict zones, extract and summarize the various reported health outcomes, and address knowledge gaps.\nQuantitative, qualitative, and mixed method studies will be included to explore the physical, mental, and social consequences of sexual violence. The WHO definition of sexual violence will guide the review to ensure consistency and alignment with global standards. Search terms will be selected with the assistance of a health information specialist and based on previous research. Only peer-reviewed articles will be included. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts.. Selected articles will be assessed for quality using the MMAT tool. Covidence will be used to assist in the study selection and data extraction.\nThe objective of this study is to assess the reported health consequences of CRSV. Key research questions include the following: how sexual violence is defined in the literature; its physical, mental, and social health consequences; how perpetrators and the type of sexual violence are portrayed; and the contextual factors that facilitate or hinder such violence in conflict settings.\nIn light of ongoing global conflicts, this review will address the urgent need to understand the health consequences of CRSV. Building on previous work, including Ba and Bhopal (Public Health 1(142):121-35, 2017) and to supplement Rubini et al. (Int J Equity Health 27(22):1-227, 2023), this study integrates quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method research within a Biopsychosocial Model (Engel, Fam Syst Med 1977:317-31, 1992) framework to provide a holistic perspective on CRSV. Recognizing challenges such as underreporting by the survivors-shaped by stigma, safety concerns, and survivor agency (Mannergren-Selimovic, Peacebuilding 30:1-15, 2018)-this review also considers how perpetrators and experiences are portrayed.\nPROSPERO (CRD42024503037).",

      "title": "Who receives health advice? Prevalence and correlates of receiving health advice among adults in Cape Verde.",
      "abstract": "Achieving the sustainable development goal target 3.4 requires an all-hand-on-deck approach. Healthcare professionals are expected to provide health advice on lifestyle changes that will reduce the risk of developing non-communicable diseases, or improve the quality of life of those who already have the condition. The study examined the prevalence and correlates of receiving health advice among adults in Cape Verde.\nWe analyzed the data 1,098 adults aged 18-69 years who participated in the 2020 WHO STEPS survey. All estimates were weighted. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression were performed to assess correlates of receiving at least one health advice. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05, with 95% confidence intervals reported.\nOverall, 60.4% (95%CI: 55.3, 62.3) of adults in Cape Verde had received at least one health advice. Compared to younger adults (< 30 years), individuals aged 30-59 years having 1.55 times higher odds (AOR = 1.55, 95%CI: 1.11-2.15) and those aged 60 years and older having nearly three times the odds (AOR = 2.93, 95%CI: 1.71-5.02) of receiving advice. Previously married (AOR = 1.69, 95%CI: 1.09-2.61) and cohabiting individuals had higher odds (AOR = 1.56, 95%CI: 1.12-2.18) of receiving advice compared to those who were never married. Alcohol consumption was inversely associated with receiving advice, as drinkers had 40% lower odds of receiving advice compared to non-drinkers (AOR = 0.60, 95%CI: 0.45-0.81). Individuals consuming fewer than four servings of fruit per day had significantly lower odds of receiving advice (AOR = 0.58, 95%CI: 0.37-0.90), while those consuming fewer than four servings of vegetables per day had 1.41 times higher odds (AOR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.06-1.88). The likelihood of receiving health advice was high among those living with hypertension (AOR = 1.94, 95%CI: 1.41-2.65).\nEvidence from this study suggests that there is a moderately high prevalence of receiving health advice in Cape Verde. The key correlates are hypertension status, increasing age, marital status, alcohol consumption and dietary habits. The findings underscore the need for targeted health education and counseling strategies that address the unique needs of different population subgroups, particularly younger adults, non-drinkers, and those with suboptimal dietary habits, to ensure equitable access to health advice.",

      "abstract": "National prevalence estimates of exclusive breastfeeding practices could serve as the basis for future policy efforts and specific interventions. However, little is known about the prevalence and factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding practices in Afghanistan. This study aims to determine the prevalence and factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding practices among infants aged 0-5 months in Afghanistan.\nMultiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) data collected between 2022 and 2023 were used for this analysis. Data from 3,141 mother-infant dyads were included in the study. The outcome variable was exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), defined as the proportion of infants 0-5 months of age who were fed only breast milk in the past 24 h. Binary logistic regression models were applied to examine the likelihood of EBF across the categories of independent variables.\nIn the studied population, 67.0% (95%CI 65%-69%) of the infants were exclusively breastfed. The likelihood of EBF was higher in infants born to mothers with secondary or higher education [AOR = 1.35, 95%CI 1.04-1.76] and in infants with timely initiation of breastfeeding [AOR = 1.25, 95%CI 1.07-1.46]. However, the female sex of the infant was associated with lower odds of EBF practices [AOR = 0.83, 95%CI 0.72-0.97].\nThe practice of exclusive breastfeeding is at a good level (67%) in Afghanistan. Higher maternal education level, timely breastfeeding initiation, and being a male infant increased the likelihood of EBF practices.

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal brain tumor. With the current gold standard chemotherapy treatment, temozolomide (TMZ), many patients do not survive beyond one year. While the urgency of researching novel treatments is understandable, the prohibitively high costs and the prolonged duration of research and clinical trials significantly delay the availability of medical advancements to the general public. This highlights the urgent need for adjuvant therapies to enhance treatment effectiveness.\nRecent research has suggested the potential of repurposing FDA-approved drugs such as temozolomide (TMZ), disulfiram (DSF), and aspirin for the treatment of glioblastoma, with encouraging evidence particularly for DSF and aspirin. Additionally, compounds like histone deacetylase inhibitors (e.g., vorinostat) are being investigated for their impact on non-coding RNA (ncRNA) modulation, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Combining traditional therapies with ncRNA modulation has shown potential in enhancing therapeutic efficacy and targeting specificity. NcRNAs play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and have been implicated in tumor growth, invasion, and treatment resistance. Recent discoveries, such as cuproptosis, offer new insights into tumor cell death mechanisms.\nThis review focuses on how these molecular insights can serve as novel therapeutic targets and how drug adjuvant therapy may improve GBM treatment strategies. It focuses on how the integration of ncRNA modulation with conventional therapies and the combination strategy of enhancing efficacy of drugs can enhance treatment efficacy and pave the way for innovative approaches in managing GBM. In short, we will explore how non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) might serve as promising targets and how repurposing TMZ, DSF, and aspirin could help enhance the efficacy of GBM treatment.",

      "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with high mortality rates of up to 40% due to multiple organ dysfunction. Systemic inflammatory response plays a key role in the pathophysiology and progression of this disease. Therefore, anti-inflammatory drugs can be considered as augmentation therapy for the management of the early phase of inflammation in septic patients, along with appropriate antimicrobial therapy and source control. Experimental studies suggest the beneficial effects of colchicine in animal septic models. However, the clinical effects of colchicine in the setting of sepsis have not been investigated yet.\nThis prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial will be conducted at Imam Reza Hospital, the largest northwest referral hospital, in Tabriz, Iran. A total of 44 patients aged 18 to 80 years with sepsis diagnosis will be randomized 1:1 to receive colchicine 1 mg daily or placebo for 10 days. The primary outcome is interleukin-6 (IL-6) changes from the baseline through day 4. Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and qSOFA scores will be evaluated at baseline, day 4, and day 10. Patients will be assessed regarding the need for supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor from the randomization through day 4 and day 10.\nThe Colchicine IN Sepsis (COLINS) trial will be the first to investigate colchicine's efficacy versus placebo in sepsis patients.

Whether to prescribe pharmacological thromboprophylaxis presents a clinical dilemma, balancing the benefit of reducing VTE risk with the potential for increasing hemorrhagic events in these patients. Currently, strong evidence and established protocols for routine pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in this population are lacking. Therefore, a randomized, controlled trial is warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of combined pharmacological and mechanical thromboprophylaxis in reducing postoperative VTE risk in patients with CD.\nThis investigator-initiated, multi-center, prospective, randomized, open-label trial with blinded outcome assessment aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined pharmacological and mechanical thromboprophylaxis compared to mechanical thromboprophylaxis alone in postoperative patients with CD. A total of 206 patients diagnosed with CD who will be undergoing transsphenoidal surgery will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either combined pharmacological and mechanical thromboprophylaxis (intervention) or mechanical thromboprophylaxis only (control).

The dependent variable includes the risk of neonatal mortality 0-30 days. Bivariate and Multivariate analyses were conducted by utilizing the Cox proportional hazards and regression models. The estimation of mortality rates was achieved through generalized structural equation modelling (GSEM) and the 5000 bootstrap technique. All the investigations were carried out in STATA v. 16.1.\nOur results revealed that around 2.46% of neonatal deaths occur. The average healthcare provider distribution type was professional, 83.45%, non-professional, 1.45%, and no care, 15.11%. 0.88% of females are less likely to die within the first thirty days of their birth compared to males. The regression outcomes demonstrate that the healthcare providers were positive and significantly linked to neonatal mortality. Additionally, a unit increase in healthcare providers has a 1.20% Higher likelihood of increasing the MCH and overall reducing neonatal mortality (HR = 0.60).\nThe outcomes illustrate that healthcare provider distribution and MCH play a vital role in minimizing neonatal mortality. To ensure well-distributed healthcare provider distribution, promoting maternal education, empowering women's decision-making in acquiring MCH services utilization, and expanding access to free MCH services are the essentials for better maternal and healthcare outcomes.",

      "title": "The aging immune system and all-cause mortality in older americans: differences across sex and race/ethnicity.",
      "abstract": "As individuals age, the immune system undergoes complex changes, including an increase in the number of CD8 T cells relative to CD4 T cells, a decline in naïve cell production (including T and B cells), and an accumulation of terminally differentiated cells with diminished functionality. These age-related immune alterations collectively contribute to immunosenescence, a phenotype associated with aging-related declines and diseases such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, and diabetes. Premature mortality at older ages often results from cumulative health deterioration initiated by physiological dysregulation over the life course. Mortality risk, therefore, provides a meaningful measure of the long-term impact of physiological changes, including those related to the immune system. Examining the link between mortality risk and immune aging in older adults could illuminate the underlying pathology of aging-related health decline. This study uses data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a national, population-based sample of middle-aged and older Americans, to explore the relationship between specific immune aging ratios and six-year mortality, stratified by race/ethnicity and sex.\nUsing a sample of 8,259 individuals from the HRS, we found that overall, the presence, magnitude, and direction of the association differed by the specific immune ratio measure, sex, and race/ethnicity. We found particularly robust associations among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black females. Among Hispanic females, for example, a one-unit increase in the log CD4 EMRA: Naïve ratio was associated with a nearly 50% increase in mortality for Hispanic females and a 25% increase in mortality for non-Hispanic Black females which was robust to adjustment for additional covariates. While we found little evidence of an association between immune function and mortality among non-Hispanic White and Hispanic males, we found associations in the opposite direction as what we would expect among non-Hispanic Black males. For example, a one-unit increase in the CD4, EMRA: Naïve ratio was associated with a 15% decrease in mortality among non-Hispanic Black males.\nOur findings demonstrate that associations between immune aging and mortality are not uniform but instead vary in magnitude and direction across sex and racial/ethnic subgroups. The strongest and most consistent associations were observed among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black females-groups experiencing multiple forms of marginalization-suggesting that these populations may face heightened vulnerability to the downstream consequences of immune aging. However, the absence or reversal of expected associations in some subgroups-particularly non-Hispanic Black males-underscores the complexity of immune aging processes and their interaction with social and biological contexts. These results highlight the importance of disaggregated analyses and suggest that immune aging may manifest and impact mortality risk differently across populations.",

      "abstract": "Early childhood untreated caries (ECC) has numerous adverse effects on children and remains more prevalent in Asia than the global average. Despite recent improvements in ECC prediction and treatment, inequalities related to parental education and economic status may persist and have potentially worsened in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study analyzed the trends and associated factors of education- and economy- related inequalities in ECC among 5-year-old children in Guangdong, China, from 2005 to 2021.\nData from three cross-sectional surveys from Guangdong, China, were utilized, including dental examinations of 2,584 five-year-old children and parental questionnaires. Logistic regression models and education-economy-related interactions were used to identify factors associated with ECC. The Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and Relative Index of Inequality (RII), derived from linear regression models, were applied to access trends in inequalities over the survey years.\nChildren living in rural areas (OR = 1.97, 95%CI = 1.47 to 2.64) and those who have dental visits because of treatment (OR = 5.73, 95%CI = 2.73 to 12.05) were associated with a higher chance of having ECC, compared to their urban and non-visiting counterparts. Children whose parents had high (OR = 0.53, 95%CI = 0.31 to 0.88) or medium (OR = 0.64, 95%CI = 0.41 to 0.99) educational levels and those had high (OR = 0.60, 95%CI = 0.43 to 0.85) and medium (OR = 0.59, 95%CI = 0.42 to 0.84) economic levels were associated with a lower chance of having ECC compared those with levels. The highest education- and economy- related SII were observed in 2005. These declined by 14.0 and 4.3% points, respectively, in 2015, but increased again by 9.8 and 0.4% points in 2021. Besides, inequality as measured by SII increased continuously in rural areas. The RII values reflected similar trends in inequality distribution.\nChildren from rural areas, lower parental education and family economic level exhibited significantly higher ECC prevalence. The education- and economy- related inequalities persisted across different groups and demonstrated a downward trend overall, but inequalities have continued to rise in rural regions from 2005 to 2021.",

      "abstract": "Obesity indices that combine anthropometric and lipid measurements, such as the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), cardiometabolic index (CMI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), metabolic score for insulin resistance (Mets-IR), triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, and visceral adiposity index (VAI), have been recommended as surrogates for assessing cardiometabolic risk. This study aimed to examine the association between these indices and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) incidence risk using large routine health checkup data.\nThis retrospective cohort study involved 195,989 participants aged 35-74 years who attended the Specific Health Checkups in 2015 and were observed until 2021 in Fukushima, Japan. We used multivariable Cox regression analysis to examine the associations between the indices and T2DM risk and evaluated the diagnostic utility of the indices.\nThe accumulated T2DM incidence rate per 100,000 person-years over a mean follow-up of 4.61 years was 706.6 in males and 441.2 in females. Multiple adjusted hazard ratios were significantly higher in the highest quartile of indices (1.33-4.22 fold higher) compared to the lowest quartile. The increased risk in the higher quartiles was more pronounced in participants aged < 50 years than in those aged ≥ 50 years for both sexes. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) of AIP, CMI, LAP, and VAI were between 0.821 and 0.844, whereas those of Mets-IR and TyG were between 0.756 and 0.780. For both sexes, AUCs for AIP, CMI, and LAP showed no significant differences (P values > 0.05), but other pairwise indices had significant differences (P values < 0.001). AUCs were higher in participants with a body mass index (BMI) of < 25 kg/m2 or aged < 50 years than in those with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 or aged ≥ 50 years, respectively. Net reclassification improvements of models for CMI and LAP were similar to AIP, while those for Mets-IR, TyG, and VAI were significantly lower than AIP.\nObesity indices are positively associated with and applicable for predicting new-onset T2DM in Japanese adults, particularly AIP, CMI, and LAP.",

In 2018, doravirine became the latest non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor to be approved in the US. We assessed changes in weight over time among virologically suppressed individuals who switched to a regimen containing doravirine (DOR).\nFrom the US-based OPERA cohort, treatment-experienced adults with HIV who switched to a DOR-containing regimen between 30AUG2018-30NOV2022 with a viral load < 50 copies/mL were included (followed through 31MAY2023). The study population was characterized and a linear mixed model was used to estimate rates of weight change on DOR. Results were stratified by sex, by patterns of efavirenz (EFV) and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) use before/after switch to DOR, and by integrase inhibitor (INSTI) & tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) use combination (restricted to individuals who maintained the same combination before/after switch).\nOf 388 included individuals, 21% were women, 33% were Black, and 78% were obese or overweight at DOR switch. Overall, people who switched to DOR lost an average of 0.80 kg/year (95% CI: -1.32, -0.28). Both women and men experienced statistically significant weight loss; women (70% Black, 70% aged ≥ 40 years) lost weight at a rate of -1.67 kg/year (95% CI: -3.32, -0.02) and men at a rate of -0.60 kg/year (95% CI: -1.12, -0.08). When EFV and TDF were absent before and after switch to DOR, statistically significant weight loss was observed. Among those who had the same INSTI and TAF combination throughout and had any INSTI or TAF use, a statistically non-significant trend toward weight loss was observed.\nIn one of the first real-world analyses of weight changes among virologically suppressed individuals who switched to a DOR-containing regimen in the US, DOR was associated with statistically significant weight loss. Patterns of use of other antiretrovirals did not fully explain the observed weight loss. These findings are clinically meaningful given that most individuals included were overweight or obese at switch to DOR and that women were predominantly of perimenopausal or menopausal age.",

Other facets of wildlife disease data - particularly negative results - are often withheld or, at best, summarized in a descriptive table with limited metadata. Here, we propose a minimum data and metadata reporting standard for wildlife disease studies. Our data standard identifies a set of 40 data fields (9 required) and 24 metadata fields (7 required) sufficient to standardize and document a dataset consisting of records disaggregated to the finest possible spatial, temporal, and taxonomic scale. We illustrate how this standard is applied to an example study, which documented a novel alphacoronavirus found in bats in Belize. Finally, we outline best practices for how data should be formatted for optimal re-use, and how researchers can navigate potential safety concerns around data sharing.",

A total of 22,700 participants aged ≥ 18 years and diagnosed with at least one chronic disease were included in the analysis. Sleep problems were defined as extreme sleep durations (either < 5 or ≥ 10 h) and insomnia. Mental illness was classified as a self-reported mood or anxiety disorder.\nParticipants with extreme sleep durations (compared to 7 to < 8 h) and those with insomnia (compared to no insomnia) showed a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicidal plans, and increased healthcare utilization. After adjusting for multiple covariates, both extreme sleep durations and insomnia remained significantly associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation, suicidal plans, and healthcare utilization. Mediation analyses indicated that mental illness partially mediated these associations.\nBoth extreme sleep durations and insomnia were independently associated with higher odds of suicidal behaviors and increased healthcare utilization in adults with chronic diseases, with mental illness playing a partial mediating role in these relationships.",

Understanding how these factors interact within socio-economic ecosystems is essential to formulating sustainable strategies to improve child survival outcomes.\nThis study employs multiple linear regression to analyze the statistical associations between economic growth, healthcare investment, immunization, malnutrition, and under-five mortality in Sri Lanka. Using secondary data from the World Bank and UNICEF (2000-2021), U5MR was modeled against economic growth (per capita GDP), government healthcare expenditure (GHE), immunization coverage (DTP1), and malnutrition (MLN), with significance assessed through p-values and model fit via R².\nThe multiple linear regression model demonstrated strong explanatory power, accounting for 85% of the variation in under-five mortality (R² = 0.85). Economic growth and immunization coverage were negatively associated with U5MR and found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05 and p < 0.10 respectively), indicating their potential role in reducing child mortality. Malnutrition showed a strong positive association (p < 0.01), emphasizing its continued threat to child health. Although government healthcare expenditure had a negative association, it was not statistically significant, suggesting possible inefficiencies in resource utilization.\nThe study highlights the significant role of economic growth, healthcare expenditure, immunization coverage, and nutrition in shaping U5MR trends in Sri Lanka.

      "abstract": "Before implementing vector control interventions, it is important to assess the mosquito species composition and their biting and resting behaviour. In preparation for an indoor residual spraying campaign for malaria control in Sakassou, Central Côte d'Ivoire, baseline entomological data were collected to characterize the local vector species composition and their biting behaviour.\nA longitudinal entomological survey was carried out from November 2018 to July 2020 with monthly assessments, except in April and May 2020 due to lockdown restriction of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mosquitoes were collected with the human landing catch method outside and inside of four houses, with two houses located in an urban setting and two in a rural setting. Additionally, in each setting, 15 houses were sampled using the pyrethrum spray catch method and two houses with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light traps. Mosquitoes were identified morphologically to the lowest possible taxonomic level, while a subset of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) specimens were further determined to species level by diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Parity and Plasmodium sporozoite rates were estimated from a subsample of the caught specimens by dissecting the ovaries and screening heads and thoraces using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.\nOverall, 98,346 mosquitoes, including 91,799 anophelines and 6,547 culicines, were collected with counts following the rain pattern. Anopheles gambiae s.l. was the predominant taxon (90%). Out of 826 specimens successfully screened with a diagnostic PCR, all were identified as Anopheles coluzzii. The estimated biting rates of An. coluzzii were high, peaking shortly after midnight. The overall Plasmodium falciparum infection rate in An. coluzzii was 0.02 (95% confidence interval: 0.01-0.03).\nAnopheles coluzzii is the main malaria vector in Sakassou, exhibiting indoor resting and biting behaviours, with the peak biting rate after midnight when people are likely to be asleep. Given these characteristics, both insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying hold promise for malaria vector control. As biting started early in the evening when people tend to be outside, outdoor interventions should also be considered.",

      "abstract": "The sustained monoculture and irregular planting practices rendered the cultivated Coptis chinensis more prone to various diseases compared to its wild counterparts. Rewilding the rhizomicrobiome of cultivated plants has emerged as a promising strategy to promote plant growth, but ancestral microbiota suitable for C. chinensis remain largely uncharted.\nThe amplicon data analyses revealed that habitat transition strongly influenced the rhizosphere microbial communities. The rhizomicrobiomes of wild C. chinensis encompassed a more diverse array of ecological groups and exhibited a greater functional diversity compared to their cultivated counterparts. A higher proportion of beneficial fungi was observed in the rhizosphere of wild C. chinensis, while the cultivated plants had a higher population of pathogenic fungi. Furthermore, a well-documented plant-growth-promoting rhizobacterium genus, Paraburkholderia, was found to play an essential role in the resistance of the wild C. chinensis to potential disease caused by Ilyonectria. Two strains of Paraburkholderia (Paraburkholderia nemoris and Paraburkholderia phytofirmans) were isolated, and in vitro experiments confirmed that these isolates possess various growth-promoting properties and antagonistic activities against known pathogens for C. chinensis root rot. Both of the Paraburkholderia isolates could markedly promote the plant immune response and enhance the overall health of the cultivated C. chinensis.\nBy a comprehensive comparison of the rhizosphere microbiome between wild and cultivated C. chinensis, the promising bacterial genus Paraburkholderia was identified as a beneficial microbe significantly promoting the growth of C. chinensis, providing pivotal insights for future endeavors aimed at engineering the rhizosphere microbiome of C. chinensis, as well as other medicinal herbs.

      "abstract": "While numerous studies have examined the subjective response to alcohol as an intermediate phenotype to understand its variability, heritability, and predictive capacity for alcohol-related disorders, in-depth analyses linking alcohol reactivity indicators to genetic factors within a large cohort have been absent. Our study aimed to quantify the exact contribution of each genetic variant relevant to the alcohol metabolism to the variability in alcohol response. Specifically, we focused on two primary genes involved in alcohol metabolism (ALDH2 and ADH1B) and three additional loci (ALDH1B1, ALDH1A1, and GCKR) that have been shown to have significant associations with drinking behaviors in Japanese individuals. We conducted the first study to assess the relationship between subjective response to alcohol (SR), evaluated by various assessment subscales, and genetic factors using an intravenous clamp technique in 429 healthy Japanese young adults. By reducing the dimensionality of the data to assess similarity structures, we identified three distinct clusters of SRs and participants. Each participant cluster exhibited a distinct alcohol response profile shaped by specific genetic contributions. Participant cluster 1 demonstrated the strongest response, followed by participant cluster 2, and then participant cluster 3. Participant cluster 1 may also be the most strongly influenced by the allelic status of ALDH2 and ADH1B. SR patterns varied accordingly, and the enrichment of the ALDH2*2 and ADH1B*2, differed across both participant and subscale clusters. Notably, the three participant clusters closely aligned with the three subscale clusters, highlighting a consistent genotype-phenotype relationship. Furthermore, the proportion of variance explained by these genes also varied across subscale clusters. Contrary to known functions, ADH1B showed associations at later timings when ALDH2 associations attenuate. Our three-cluster classification may improve prevention by enabling early identification of individuals at health risk.",

Here we describe a novel nonenzymatic function of LKB1 in cell death induced by Fas/CD95. In BID knockout HeLa cells, inactivation of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) prevents Smac-induced inhibition of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), causing resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis. However, reexpression of LKB1 in those cells naturally deficient for endogenous LKB1 restored apoptosis. Mechanistically, caspase-8 activated by Fas processed LKB1 to a truncated form, tLKB1. Both WT and kinase-inactive LKB1 antagonized XIAP to restore apoptosis, but somatic mutants of LKB1 found in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) failed to do so. Thus, in addition to the known caspase-8 / tBid / Smac / XIAP pro-apoptotic axis, our results unveil a novel one, caspase-8 / tLKB1 / XIAP that potentially contributes to the antitumor functions of LKB1.",

Mechanical stress, such as exercise, can influence OA progression, acting as either a therapeutic intervention or a risk factor depending on intensity. The sensory neuropeptide αCGRP plays a role in modulating cartilage, bone, and inflammatory responses, making it a potential mediator of exercise effects on OA. This study investigated the impact of αCGRP deficiency and exercise intensity on OA progression in a post-traumatic murine model.\nOA was induced in male αCGRP knockout (KO) and wild type (C57Bl/6J) mice via destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM). Mice underwent moderate or intense treadmill exercise for up to 6 weeks (8 weeks post-surgery). Histological analyses were performed to assess cartilage degradation. Subchondral and metaphyseal bone morphology as well as cartilage stiffness were evaluated by nanoCT and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. Serum inflammatory markers were analyzed using multiplex immunoassays.\nSerum levels of proinflammatory markers were elevated in αCGRP-deficient mice, particularly after intense exercise, independent of OA progression. DMM surgery induced significant cartilage degradation. Gross cartilage morphology was not influenced by exercise intensity or αCGRP deficiency, but αCGRP deficiency prevented articular cartilage extracellular matrix stiffening after DMM and intense exercise. Subchondral bone sclerosis was induced by αCGRP deficiency and DMM but mitigated by intense exercise. In metaphyseal bone, intense exercise induced trabecular loss in αCGRP-deficient mice.\nThis study highlights αCGRP as an intrinsic regulator of joint and bone responses to mechanical loading during OA. While cartilage degradation after DMM and treadmill exercise was unaffected by lack of αCGRP, its deficiency altered ECM stiffness, bone remodeling, and inflammatory responses. These findings position αCGRP as a critical regulator of joint homeostasis, particularly for bone health during running exercise and OA progression.",

The standard investigation is comprised of exercise bicycle stress testing and echocardiography.\nThe trial involves patients with a pre-test probability > 15% for significant CAD referred from primary healthcare centers (PHCs) in Region Östergötland (population 471,241 in March 2023) in south-east Sweden. All the 47 PHCs of the region will be invited to participate and will, after approval, be cluster randomized into two groups: package investigation versus standard investigation.
