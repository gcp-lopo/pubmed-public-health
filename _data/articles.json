      "title": "Immune persistence of a single dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine: A 6-year follow-up.",
      "abstract": "In a previous phase 3 clinical trial, a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) induced robust immune responses in participants aged 2 years and older. We conducted this study to evaluate the immune persistence of a single dose of PPV23 6 years after vaccination. In this follow-up study, 600 participants aged 2 years and older (referred to the age of vaccination) who had received a single dose of either test vaccine or control vaccine in the previous clinical trial were enrolled in a 3:1 ratio. Blood samples were collected to determine anti-capsular immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels against 23 serotypes with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A total of 598 subjects were included for immune persistence analysis. Six years after vaccination, the geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of IgG antibodies to most serotypes remained higher than prior to vaccination in both groups (1.1-1.8 folds vs.1.1-1.7 folds), although there was a significant decrease compared to 28 days. The results suggested PPV23 could provide protection 6 years after vaccination. Considering the significant decrease of antibody level, the revaccination in high-risk population may be needed.Trial registration: ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT03480763.",

      "title": "The social determinants of tuberculosis: a case-control study characterising pathways to equitable intervention in Peru.",
      "abstract": "Despite being key components of global tuberculosis policy, poverty reduction and social protection interventions have been inconsistently implemented. We aimed to characterise how poverty and interrelated personal risk factors increase tuberculosis risk in Peru to inform the design of locally appropriate, person-centred, equity-oriented interventions.\nWe undertook a case-control study among people aged 15 years and over in 32 communities in Peru between 2016 and 2019. Cases (n = 2337) were people diagnosed with any form of tuberculosis. Controls (n = 981) were people living in randomly selected households in the same communities. We derived measures of household poverty from three dimensions (physical, human, and financial capital) and investigated the associations between these; personal risk factors more specifically linked to health (e.g. smoking); and tuberculosis. We used logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR), 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and population attributable fractions (PAF). A directed acyclic graph was used to inform the analytical approach.\nHousehold poverty was strongly associated with tuberculosis (aOR = 3.1; 95% CI: 2.3-4.2 for people from the 'poorer' versus 'less poor' half of households). There was a non-linear social gradient across deciles of household poverty, with odds of tuberculosis increasing exponentially as poverty deepened (aOR = 12.6; 95% CI: 6.8-23.2 for the 'poorest' decile versus the 'least poor' decile). Overall, tuberculosis burden could be halved by reducing poverty in the 'poorer' half of households to the level of the 'less poor' half (PAF = 47%; 95% CI: 40-54). For key personal risk factors, we estimated PAF for alcohol excess (PAF = 12.3%, 95% CI: 7.2-17.2); underweight (PAF = 10.3%, 95% CI: 8.7-11.8); smoking (PAF = 8.8%, 95% CI: 3.8-13.5); HIV (PAF = 5.7%, 95% CI: 4.6-6.7); and diabetes (PAF = 4.6%, 95% CI: 3.3-6.0). We also identified other important risk factors including previous tuberculosis (PAF = 14.8%, 95% CI: 11.6-17.9); incarceration (PAF = 9.5%, 95% CI: 6.8-12.1); and lower social capital (PAF = 4.1%, 95% CI: 2.6-5.6). Most personal risk factors, particularly education and substance misuse, tuberculosis exposures (e.g. incarceration and homelessness), and undernutrition, exhibited a social gradient across quintiles of household poverty and were more prevalent in people living in poorer households (Cochran-Armitage test for linear trend P < 0.001 for variables showing these social gradients).\nInterventions addressing multidimensional household poverty and interrelated personal risk factors could substantially reduce tuberculosis burden. Our results provide an evidence base for designing person-centred, equity-oriented interventions; and support more effective implementation of poverty reduction and social protection within the global tuberculosis response.",

      "title": "Changes in influenza-associated excess mortality in China between 2012-2019 and 2020-2021: a population-based statistical modelling study.",
      "abstract": "The seasonal cycle of the influenza virus causes substantial morbidity and mortality globally. The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the circulation of influenza viruses can influence influenza-associated excess mortality. Given the few studies that have explored this topic, the objective of this study was to evaluate influenza-associated excess mortality in the Chinese mainland from 2012 to 2021 and quantify the changes from 2020 to 2021 compared with 2012-2019.\nUsing data from national influenza surveillance report and disease surveillance points, we fitted a generalized additive model on all-cause (AC), pneumonia & influenza (P&I), and respiratory (R) mortality rates. In this model, we included data of influenza activity (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B), temperature, absolute humidity, the COVID-19 pandemic, and time trends. The excess mortality was estimated by subtracting the fitted baseline mortality from the predicted mortality, which set influenza activity to zero.\nThe respiratory mortality model explained more than 90% of the variance, indicating the good performance. We found that the influenza-associated mortality was generally decreasing from 2020 to 2021, for instance, influenza A/H1N1-associated excess respiratory mortality (ERM) decreased from 2.62 per 100,000 persons (95% confidence interval: 0.16-5.21) to 0.31 (0.02-0.60) in the northern region and from 3.79 (0.09-7.05) to 0.24 (0.02-0.46) in the southern region between 2012-2019 and 2020-2021. A similar pattern was observed for A/H3N2-associated ERM. While the influenza B remained similar scale, for instance, the ERM was 2.90 (0.72-4.3) and 2.26 (1.76-2.76) in the southern region between 2012-2019 and 2020-2021, respectively. Distinct pattern was observed for the AC and P&I outcomes.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has reduced influenza-associated excess mortality, which may be a result of the reduced activity of the influenza virus caused by nonpharmaceutical interventions. Different patterns of regional differences differed for influenza-associated AC, P&I and R mortality. It should be noticed that the contribution of influenza B was generally similar when comparing 2012-2019 and 2020-2021, which highlighted the attention on the influenza B activity. Additional studies are needed to explore the changes in influenza-associated excess mortality afterwards.",

      "abstract": "Traditional in-person neuropsychological tests remain inaccessible and not adapted to individuals in remote geographical locations and linguistically diverse populations. We aimed to make neuropsychological tests more accessible and adapted to diverse populations by leveraging the internet. We examined the feasibility, discriminability, and generalizability of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-video conferencing version (MoCA-VC) across geographically and linguistically diverse populations. We tested 250 participants from 120+ locations in the USA and Israel, using a standardized MoCA-VC protocol in English, Hebrew, or Arabic. Performance followed expected significant trends across language-speaking cohorts: young adults (YA)>older adults (OA)>people with Parkinson's Disease (PwP), confirming discriminative abilities. However, while the YA groups performed similarly across the three language-speaking cohorts, the OA and PwP Arabic-speaking cohorts demonstrated significantly lower scores, indicating limited generalizability. While these findings support MoCA-VC's feasibility and discriminability, they underscore the need to adapt online cognitive assessments across geographical locations and languages, ensuring greater accessibility worldwide.",

      "title": "Unveiling viral diversity and dynamics in mosquitoes through metagenomic analysis in Guizhou Province, China.",
      "abstract": "Poverty, disease, and vector ecology intersect to present ongoing health threats, particularly in ecologically sensitive regions. Guizhou Province in China, with its complex karst topography and rich biodiversity, offers a unique environment to study mosquito-borne viral transmission. Despite over 5000 reported cases of Japanese encephalitis in the past two decades and the detection of Zika virus in 2016, the virological landscape of this region remains poorly understood. This study aims to characterize the mosquito-associated virome, assess viral diversity, and identify factors influencing transmission dynamics in Guizhou Province.\nBetween 2021 and 2022, we conducted a 2-year mosquito surveillance across eight ecologically distinct regions in Guizhou Province. Adult mosquitoes were collected using a variety of methods, including BG Mosquitaire CO2 traps, mosquito-killing lamps, manual collection, human bait traps, and oviposition traps. To investigate the virome diversity and dynamics within mosquito populations, we performed metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics analysis on pooled mosquito samples collected from geographically diverse sampling sites.\nWe collected more than 40,000 adult mosquitoes, primarily belonging to four genera: Aedes, Anopheles, Armigeres, and Culex. Dominant species included Aedes albopictus, Anopheles sinensis, Armigeres subalbatus, and Culex tritaeniorhynchus. Notably, we report the first provincial record of the Anopheles baileyi complex, expanding the known distribution of mosquito vector in this region. Viral metagenomic sequencing, coupled with bioinformatic analysis, identified 162 viral contigs, including 140 known and 22 previously uncharacterized viruses. We experimentally confirmed the genotypes of three medically important zoonotic viruses: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV-GI), Getah virus (GETV-GIII) and Banna virus (BAV-A2). Comparative analysis of viral abundance across mosquito species revealed that Aedes albopictus populations in Guizhou harbor a distinct virome composition, diverging from those reported in other geographic regions.\nThis study presents the comprehensive characterization of the mosquito-associated virome in Guizhou Province, providing critical insights into viral diversity, vector competence, and transmission dynamics within karst ecosystems. The detection of multiple zoonotic viruses highlights the need for strengthened surveillance and targeted public health interventions in this region.",

      "title": "Avian spring migration at the east Adriatic coast: coastal and sea-crossing dynamics of intensity, timing, and flight directions.",
      "abstract": "Each spring, migratory birds converge along the Croatian coast from various directions, creating a dynamic intersection of flight paths. Many birds are thought to cross the Adriatic Sea, while others follow a northward route along the coastline. As most migratory birds initiate flight shortly after sunset, we hypothesized that sea-crossing migrants would arrive with a delay at the Croatian coast, compared to migrants that were following the coast, resulting in potentially intricate spatiotemporal patterns that remain poorly understood.\nWe deployed four ornithological radar devices along the Croatian coastline: two in southwestern Istria and two in northern Dalmatia. These radars tracked migratory bird activity up to 1000 m above ground, recording intensity and flight directions and their variations across sites, seasons, and individual nights. We conducted an exploratory analysis of these variations, applied functional principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering to summarise within-night activity profiles, and compared these profiles between sites and across the migration season, alongside associated flight direction distributions.\nDuring the early migration season, migration intensity was similar across all technically active sites, but site-to-site variation increased markedly in May. In March, flight directions were predominantly towards NNE, indicating mainly sea-crossing migration throughout the night. In April, NW directions dominated the first half of the night, shifting to scattered N directions later; in Dalmatia, even strong W components were observed early in the night. By May, W to NW movement towards the Italian coast were typical for early-night activity. Later in the night, flight directions shifted towards NE over Istria and N at the Dalmatian site in Zadar, while the site at Vrana exhibited a wide scatter, warranting further discussion. Contrary to our expectations, within-night intensity profiles could not be fully linked to specific directional patterns.\nThis study points to the complex interplay between coastal and sea-crossing migration along the Croatian coast. Our results demonstrate significant variability in the timing of migration within single nights in the context of aquatic barriers. Crossing such a barrier results in downstream delays compared to birds migrating along the barrier. Between nights, one behaviour or the other may dominate the overall activity, causing the shifts in within-night timing. In addition, barrier crossing is likely to be strongly influenced by weather conditions, contributing to the variability in the within-night timing of migration. However, measured flight directions were not always consistent with within-night timing, highlighting the complexity of avian migration in the context of aquatic barriers. This highlights the need for further research with high temporal resolution to gain a deeper understanding of migration behaviour in response to such barriers.",

      "title": "Associations of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep patterns with cognitive function among middle-aged and older adults.",
      "abstract": "Despite the established evidence that physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep affect cognitive function individually, less is known about the combined effects of these movement behaviors. The study aimed to identify movement patterns of physical activity, sitting time, and sleep and to examine the association of movement patterns with cognitive function.\nThis cross-sectional study included 1,240 participants aged ≥ 55 years participating in the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study who visited the Cooper Clinic, Dallas (2016-2019) for preventive health care. Four movement behaviors were self-reported, including leisure-time aerobic activity, muscle-strengthening activity, sitting time, sleep, and other characteristics. Cognitive function was assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Four categorical indicators were created for each movement behavior and used to identify latent classes. Information criterion, scaled relative entropy and model interpretability were used to determine the optimal number of classes. Participants were assigned to the predicted classes based on their highest posterior probabilities. Multinomial regressions examined the association between movement patterns and each covariate. Linear and logistic regression models examined the association of movement patterns and cognitive function. A sensitivity analysis accounted for misclassification errors.\nParticipants were predominantly White (95%), male (71%), with an average age of 62 years. A 3-class model was selected, comprising class 1: active long sleepers, class 2: very active short sleepers, and class 3: moderately active short sleepers, representing 11%, 62%, and 27% of the sample. Compared to class 2, class 1 was more likely to be older and female, while class 3 was more likely to be female, have less education, be overweight and obese, and have chronic conditions. Compared to class 2, class 3 was associated with a lower MoCA total score, adjusting for sociodemographic factors. There were no differences in MoCA total score between class 2 and class 3 when further controlling for health behaviors and indicators. Sensitivity analysis accounting for misclassification suggested that class 3 had a significantly lower average MoCA total score than class 2.\nThe current study identified three distinct movement classes that exhibited different sociodemographic, health characteristics and cognitive functions. Findings highlight that less active, more sedentary, and shorter sleep individuals had worse cognitive function.",

      "title": "Association between dietary self-care adherence and depression among adults living with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Ghana: a cross-sectional study.",
      "abstract": "Dietary recommendation plays a quintessential role in diabetes self-management. Persons living with diabetes (PLWD) are expected to consume diets rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts, while limiting alcohol consumption, refined grains, red and processed meats, and low sugar-sweetened beverages. However, the following questions remain: (a) What is the association between dietary adherence and depression among persons living with diabetes in Ghana? (b) Do adherence to a general diet and specific diet recommendations have the same association with depression? To address these questions, we examined the association between dietary self-care adherence and depression among PLWD in Ghana.\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted in the Ashanti region of Ghana. The study involved 398 PLWD. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models were performed to assess the association between dietary adherence and depression. The results of the multivariable logistic regression were presented in adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical significance was set at < 0.05.\nOverall, we estimated a depression prevalence of 38.7% among the participants. PLWD who had a high dietary self-care adherence were significantly less likely to experience depression (COR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.11-0.66). This association remained statistically significant after adjusting for covariates (AOR = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.10-0.78). While a high general diet score was associated with lower odds of depression, it was statistically not significant. However, PLWD with a higher specific diet score were significantly less likely to experience depressive symptoms (AOR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.73-0.88).\nThe significant inverse association between adherence to specific diets and depression points to an area that clinicians and public health authorities must prioritise. Our findings suggest that encouraging PLWD to adhere to specific diet recommendations (e.g., fruit and vegetable consumption, practicing carbohydrate spacing, and consuming low-fat diets) could help reduce the risk of depression. Hence, clinicians must emphasise the mental health benefits of adhering to dietary recommendations during their dietary counselling sessions with PLWD.",

      "title": "Increasing community members' engagement in cancer research: the making research CLEAR program.",
      "abstract": "Despite the importance of engaging community members in research, multiple barriers from the perspective of the investigator and community member exist. The Making Research CLEAR (Community Learning and Experience about Research) Program aims to bridge the gap between research conducted at an NCI-designated cancer center and the community.\nCommunity members and a cancer center investigator were paired for a 6-month immersive research experience. Community members had at least one research experience per month with their investigator, while also attending cancer center activities such as Institutional Review Board (IRB) meetings, research lectures, protocol review meetings, and community outreach events. Community members and investigators completed baseline and endpoint surveys to assess perceptions and impact of the program.\nSeven community member-investigator dyads completed the program. There was strong agreement among community members that participation increased their awareness (Pre M = 4.0, Post M = 4.43) and understanding (Pre M = 3.43, Post M = 4.57) of current cancer research efforts, although there was decreased agreement that their participation would add value to the research (Pre M = 4.71, Post M = 4.57). Community members had increased interest in participating in clinical trials (Pre M = 4.29, Post M = 4.43) and their attitudes towards trials improved (Pre M = 4.57, Post M = 4.71). Their confidence in the safety and benefit of clinical trials was high at baseline (M = 4.71) yet remained unchanged at endpoint. Researchers strongly agreed that the program offered an opportunity to build trust between researchers and community members (Pre M = 4.57, Post M = 5.00) and it improved their understanding of the community's culture (Pre M = 4.57, Post M = 4.86).\nOverall, measures of community members' trust and transparency in research and clinical trials increased yet perceptions of their impact on research were mixed. Community input may have limited ability to directly impact the scientific process in a span of 6 months, but researchers' willingness to partner with community members in the future is promising.\nThe Making Research CLEAR program, launched by the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center in Philadelphia, aims to build trust between cancer researchers and community members by involving the public directly in the research process. Trust is especially crucial in cancer research, where sharing personal health data is often required. The program gives community members hands-on lab experiences and fosters open dialogue about cancer research. Initially piloted in 2022, CLEAR paired community members with researchers for 8–12 weeks. Based on participant feedback, the 2023 version expanded to six months and included better training materials. Participants, often local leaders or advocates, were matched with researchers based on shared interests. They took part in lab work, monthly meetings, and educational events focused on topics like clinical trials and research ethics. Evaluations showed that community members gained a better understanding of cancer research and felt more confident in it. Most said the program had a positive impact and would recommend it. However, some questioned whether their input truly influenced researchers or built lasting trust. Researchers, on the other hand, strongly valued community involvement, noting improved communication skills and a greater desire to collaborate with the public. Despite some differing views, both community members and researchers saw CLEAR as a beneficial initiative. The program underscores the need for open communication between scientists and the community, with the goal of improving both trust and cancer research outcomes. Future improvements may focus on fostering shared dialogue to strengthen these relationships.",

      "abstract": "Rapid urbanization is accelerating in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which impacts health behaviors and contributes to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes and hypertension. As primary care services are overstretched, urban residents rely on pharmacies, creating an urgent need to implement evidence-based approaches such as the World Health Organization's Package of Essential Non-communicable Diseases (PEN) to reach low-income households at risk of hypertension and diabetes. This study aims to identify the facilitators and barriers to the adoption, implementation, and long-term delivery of strategies to link pharmacies with public facilities in Pokhara Metropolitan City Nepal, to improve diabetes and hypertension prevention and management among poor urban populations.\nThis study uses a sequential mixed-method design within the RE-AIM framework. Data from client surveys will assess the costs and effectiveness of system linkages and interventions in improving diabetes and hypertension screening, management, and referral. Data will be collected at four time points from at least 20 clients per pharmacy and public health facility at baseline, midline, and endline and, to assess maintenance of delivery, post endline. During each time point, repeat questionnaires will be used to assess clients' adherence to lifestyle and referral advice. The quantitative data will be analyzed via descriptive statistics and logistic regression models to identify factors associated with change in major outcomes. Qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with health workers at pharmacies, clients, and public health facility staff will be analyzed via thematic analysis to identify barriers to and facilitators of intervention adoption, implementation, and sustainability. Endline and post-endline surveys will replicate baseline methods to evaluate intervention impact.\nThis study will provide insights into how private pharmacies can be linked to the public health system to provide appropriate, quality services for diabetes and hypertension within the context of a pluralistic urban health system. Using the RE-AIM framework will enable assessment across implementation domains, providing valuable insights for local governments and health systems within Nepal. Given the rapid urbanization and increasing prevalence of NCDs, which characterize the majority of LMICs, our study contributes to the understanding of how to implement such strategies to meet the needs of the urban poor in other similar contexts.",

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the intake of coffee and tea and macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\nWe used the Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), which determined the relationship between coffee and tea consumption and the risk of macrovascular complications among 14,277 UK Biobank participants.\nCompared with non-coffee or tea drinkers, those who consumed 0.5-1 cup of coffee (HR 0.67,95% CI 0.518 to 0.856) or 2-4 cups of tea (HR 0.66,95% CI 0.524 to 0.839) per day had the lowest risk of stroke; daily intake of 2-4 cups of coffee associated with reduced risk of angina pectoris (AP) (HR 0.82,95% CI 0.726 to 0.916); those who consumed 0.5-1 cup of tea per day had the lowest risk of the heart failure (HF) (HR 0.73,95% CI 0.602 to 0.879); furthermore, those who consumed 2-4 cups of coffee and 0.5-1 cup of tea per day (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.379-0.790) demonstrated the lowest risk of HF onset compared with those who did not consume coffee and tea at all.\nThis study found that in a T2DM population, moderate coffee consumption significantly lowered the risk of stroke and AP, while moderate tea intake reduced the risk of stroke and HF. Combined moderate consumption of both beverages provided optimal protection against HF.",

Here, we examine the association between kidney function and plasma ATN markers among a diverse sample of Hispanic/Latino individuals living in the U.S.\nData was collected from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL, Visit 1, 2008-2011), the largest prospective cohort study of noninstitutionalized Hispanic/Latino adults in the U.S., and its ancillary study, the Study of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA) which was conducted during the second visit of the parent HCHS/SOL study (Visit 2, 2015-2018). SOL-INCA aimed to examine the neurocognitive decline of middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino adults, and the inclusion criteria were the age of 50-years and older by Visit 2 and completion of battery of neurocognitive tests at Visit 1. Survey linear regression models were used to examine associations between CKD status (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 or urine albumin-creatinine ratio [uACR]) > = 30 mg/g) and the plasma ATN biomarkers (β-amyloid 42/40 ratio [Aβ42/40 ratio], phosphorylated-tau181 [p-Tau181], neurofilament light [NfL], and glial fibrillary associated protein [GFAP]), independently. All models adjusted for sociodemographic and cardiometabolic factors (BMI, diabetes, and hypertension).\n5,968 participants were included in the study (mean age 63.4 ± 8.1, 54% women). CKD was associated with higher p-Tau181 (b = 0.82), NfL (b = 11.60) and GFAP levels (b = 31.41), and lower Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (b=-0.004). Lower eGFR (i.e., reduced kidney function) was associated with higher p-Tau181, NfL, and GFAP levels (b ranges [-0.87 - -0.03]), and lower Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (b = 0.000). Higher (natural log) uACR was associated with lower Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and higher levels of all other biomarkers (b ranges [0.24-5.49]).

      "abstract": "Atezolizumab (A) plus carboplatin-etoposide (CE) represents the new first-line treatment in extensive stage (ES)-Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) patients. This study aims at identifying the association of baseline and dynamic changes of cfDNA, Tumor Fraction (TF) and variant allele frequency (VAF) of tumor-related mutations with median (m) overall (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in SCLC patients treated with ACE.\nThis is a single-center prospective exploratory study including treatment-naive ES-SCLC patients eligible to first-line ACE. Liquid biopsies were longitudinally collected at baseline (T0), after cycle 1 (T1) and 2 (T2), at disease progression (T3). cfDNA Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis was performed; genomic profiles and TF were inferred from shallow WGS (sWGS).\nThirty-two patients were included; mPFS and mOS were 5.19 and 7.96 months, respectively. Higher T0 cfDNA (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.17-1.77, p = 0.0006) and VAF (HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.36-4.93, p = 0.0039) were associated with risk of death; higher T0 cfDNA (HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.08-1.54, p = 0.0049), TF (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.02-3.82, p = 0.044) and VAF (HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.22-4.42, p = 0.01) were predictors of risk of PD. Among the dynamic changes in the biomarkers under investigation, the association of 10-unit increase of VAF T0-T1 and T0-T2 with OS (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.01-1.88, p = 0.043; HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.21-2.16, p = 0.008) and PFS (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.18-2.43, p = 0.004; HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.22-2.70, p = 0.003) was estimated.\nT0 and dynamic changes of cfDNA, TF and VAF may help physicians to stratify ES-SCLC patients receiving first-line ACE and to anticipate the clinical course of the disease.",

      "title": "Handling uncertainty in cost-effectiveness analysis in dental medicine: a systematic review with a focus on affordability and risk-aversion.",
      "abstract": "The number of published cost-effectiveness analyses in dental medicine has substantially increased in recent years. A key methodological issue in these analyses is how to address uncertainty in costs and effects, which also impacts uncertainty around the expected cost-effectiveness ratio. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve has become the standard method to summarize uncertainty in probabilistic cost-effectiveness analyses. However, it does not inform decision-makers about budget impact or account for the fact that they are often risk-averse. The cost-effectiveness affordability curve and the cost-effectiveness risk-aversion curve have been proposed to address these limitations. In this systematic review, we assess how uncertainty has been handled in cost-effectiveness analyses in dental medicine, with a particular focus on affordability and risk-aversion.\nWe conducted a systematic literature search across electronic databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EconLit, Embase) on April 18, 2025, and performed manual searches of selected references. Articles published after January 1, 2021, were included. From each study, we extracted information on the first author, year of publication, country, intervention evaluated, study design (model-based, trial-based, or combined), use of deterministic and/or probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and whether budget impact and risk-aversion were considered.\nFrom a total of 57 published cost-effectiveness analyses, 49 (85%) used a deterministic sensitivity analysis and 37 (65%) used a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Budget impact analysis was performed in five studies (9%), and only one study formally applied both the cost-effectiveness affordability curve and the cost-effectiveness risk-aversion curve.\nThe use of methods to address uncertainty related to budget constraints and risk-aversion remains limited in dental medicine. As decision-makers often operate within budget constraints and health is considered the most valuable good, incorporating methods that address affordability and risk-aversion could enhance the relevance and impact of cost-effectiveness analyses in dental care.",

      "abstract": "Understanding determinants of antibiotic use during pregnancy is crucial for optimizing their utilization in clinical practice. We aimed to investigate which individual-level factors are associated with antibiotic use among pregnant women.\nPopulation-based cohort study using linked data from the Swedish national health and population registers spanning from 2006 to 2019. Sociodemographic characteristics, medical and obstetric history, lifestyle and healthcare utilization were investigated as independent variables. Any systemic antibiotic use during pregnancy, the primary outcome, was determined from filled prescriptions, with broad-spectrum antibiotics and multiple courses of antibiotics as secondary outcomes. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs), including all independent variables in the model.\nAmong 20 variables associated with any systemic antibiotic use during pregnancy, preconception prescription drug use (OR 1.93 [95% CI 1.87-1.98] for > 4 vs. 0-1 unique therapeutic subgroups), chronic renal disease (1.82 [1.73-1.93]) and low maternal age (1.67 [1.61-1.74] for ages < 20 vs. 30-34 years) had the highest odds. Chronic renal disease, immunodeficiency disorders and preconception drug use (> 4 vs. 0-1 therapeutic subgroups) had the highest odds of broad-spectrum antibiotic use and use of multiple antibiotic courses.\nPre-existing morbidities and low maternal age were most strongly associated with antibiotic use during pregnancy, suggesting a needs-based approach in prescribing. Proactive management of morbidities and infection prevention strategies, particularly targeting young women of reproductive age, could potentially reduce the need for antibiotic treatment in prenatal care.",

DWI was first assessed for the presence of restricted diffusion within the optic nerve. Quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) evaluation was performed by placing a region of interest (ROI) within the affected optic nerve.

Restricted diffusion on ADC was significantly more frequent in A-AION, when compared to NA-AION (82.6% vs. 42.4%; p = 0.001). Corresponding sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of qualitative ADC assessment for the identification of A-AION were 0.83, 0.58, 0.43 and 0.89.

In Germany, population-based estimates on how many minor children have parents with gambling disorder are lacking; thus, the immediacy of need for corresponding (public) health care policies remains unknown.\nBased on the population-representative German Gambling Survey 2023, we estimated the number of children having parents with gambling disorder, including estimates for rates at each parental gambling disorder severity level (mild, moderate, severe). Both cohabiting children and separate living children were considered. To extrapolate lower and upper bounds of estimates, data on number of parents in the household and average number of children was combined with official population statistics.\nOf 282 participants with gambling disorder, 46.8% (n = 132) cohabit with 1.55 children on average; 16.7% (n = 47) are parents of 1.51 separate living children on average. Therefore, in Germany 574,079 to 604,966 children have a parent with gambling disorder, with about 84.0% of them (482,076 to 508,712) cohabiting with the gambling parent. The likelihood of cohabiting decreases with increasing gambling disorder severity (mild: 97.7%; moderate: 85.0%; severe: 72.2%).\nIn Germany about 1 in 25 children has a parent with gambling disorder. Given that parental gambling disorder is an established risk factor for developing own gambling problems, more comprehensive addiction care and health policy are needed to address this issue. Integrated care and counselling offers targeting both gambling parents and their children may be a promising starting point. Special attention should be paid to separate living children in these approaches.",

      "abstract": "Infections caused by anaerobes are common in children. However, limited data are available on bloodstream infections caused by these bacteria in Europe. A multicentre retrospective observational study was conducted over a 4-year period (2020-2023) across 44 European hospitals to analyze all anaerobes isolated from blood cultures. The study examined the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance profiles of anaerobes identified in paediatric patients, comparing the findings with those observed in adults. Among the 14,527 total anaerobic isolates, 186 (1.3%) were detected from paediatric patients. These were predominantly Gram-positive (70%) and Gram-negative (22%) bacilli. The most prevalent species in paediatric patients were Cutibacterium acnes (24.7%), Schaalia odontolytica (9.7%), Actinomyces oris (8.1%), and Bacteroides fragilis (7.5%). Relative feature importance based on the mean SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values distinguished paediatric patients and adults based on their antibiotic resistance patterns with high accuracy. Compared to those from adult patients, Gram-positive bacilli detected in paediatric samples displayed higher resistance rates for meropenem (15% vs. 9%), metronidazole (52% vs. 24%), and vancomycin (27% vs. 6%), and lower resistance to benzylpenicillin (11% vs. 17%), amoxicillin/clavulanate (9% vs. 17%), and clindamycin (30% vs. 36%). Gram-negative bacilli in paediatric samples displayed lower resistance to benzylpenicillin (18% vs. 29%), piperacillin/tazobactam (26% vs. 33%), and clindamycin (20% vs. 27%), and they were highly susceptible to imipenem, meropenem, and metronidazole as those detected in adult patients. Bacteroides species detected in paediatric and adult patients displayed high resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam (33% vs. 39%) and clindamycin (38% vs. 29%), while they were highly susceptible to metronidazole. Compared to those from adult samples, Cutibacterium acnes in paediatric patients displayed lower resistance to benzylpenicillin (none vs. 15%) and clindamycin (17% vs. 29%). The comparison of species and susceptibility profiles of anaerobes detected in paediatric and adult patients highlighted the importance of reporting antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance data by age group.",

However, the specific ways in which dog ownership impacts substance use and mental health remain underexplored. This study aimed to explore how people with SUD perceived that dog ownership affected their use of substances and mental health characteristics.\nQualitative, semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with eight individuals with experience of dog ownership and SUD. Data were gathered and analysed using a 4-step qualitative content analysis.\nThree key categories emerged from the analysis. The unique relationship with their dog encouraged the development of a new sense of self for participants that had not been previously possible. Participants reported an increased awareness and regulation of substance use, and they became more mindful of their use, often reducing or managing it to align with caring for their dog. The bond with their dog contributed to improved mental health, emotional stability and appeared to play a role in reducing suicidal ideation.\nDog ownership provided participants with a positive sense of self and reinforced feelings of self-worth. This helped them move away from impulsive or habitual substance use patterns and adopt a more intentional, less harmful approach. The relationship with the dog also appeared to stabilise participants' mental health, enabling them to navigate depressive episodes more effectively and recover from negative moods more easily.",

      "abstract": "Interventions to increase and maintain Hispanic women's moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) are lacking. Socioecological models hypothesize that MVPA participation is influenced by factors at multiple levels of the environment (i.e., intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, neighborhood, policy). These factors, including behavior change mechanisms (BCM), are targeted with behavior change techniques (BCT) delivered through interventions to improve MVPA participation. However, the specific factors and BCT that positively influence Hispanic women's MVPA remain unknown.\nSynthesize existing literature to determine the socioecological model levels, BCM, and BCT that significantly increased Hispanic women's accelerometer-measured MVPA.\nDatabases (PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane Library and PsychINFO) were searched using key terms ((Hispanic women) OR (Hispanic OR Mexican American OR Latina OR Latinx) AND (female) AND (exercise OR physical activity)) without date or geographic limitations in March 2023. Peer-reviewed studies published in English that tested interventions to increase Hispanic women's accelerometer-measured MVPA were included. Two authors extracted data, a narrative synthesis was conducted, and a conceptual model of a multilevel MVPA intervention was proposed.\nNine unique interventions were identified with four studies providing additional findings (N = 13). Studies were conducted in the United States and totaled 2,303 Hispanic women (M = 28.4-44.6 years). Self-efficacy (intrapersonal level) and family participation (interpersonal level) were the only BCM that mediated MVPA post-intervention. Half of the studies targeting the organizational (n = 3/6) and 83.3% (n = 5/6) targeting the neighborhood levels demonstrated significant improvements in MVPA. BCT targeting confidence, goals, and problem-solving at the intrapersonal level, partner support and childcare barriers at the interpersonal level, and physical activity access with methods to overcome weather and safety barriers at the neighborhood level significantly improved MVPA post-intervention. None of the interventions tested for longer-term (i.e., > 9-months post-intervention) MVPA change.\nInterventions to increase Hispanic women's accelerometer-measured MVPA in the shorter-term should be developed to include BCT to increase self-efficacy (intrapersonal level) and family participation (interpersonal level) and identify physical activity opportunities/access (neighborhood level), including BCT to overcome safety and weather barriers. Future research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the socioecological levels, BCM, and BCT to maintain Hispanic women's MVPA in the longer term.\nThe 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist was followed for this systematic review.

Red cell units from such blood donors with DEL alleles are RhD protein-positive, despite being routinely labelled D-negative. Molecular typing offers a more sensitive method to identify Del individuals by detecting the presence of the RHD gene. Pools of 20 or more donor samples are routinely screened for the RHD gene in some, mostly European, donor populations.\nA modular real-time PCR assay targeting RHD intron 4, exon 5, and exon 7 was developed for individual testing. We screened for the RHD gene among all blood donors who typed D-negative in routine serology.\nOver 15 years, 2254 D-negative donors were individually tested for the RHD gene. With a sensitivity of detecting 5 RHD positive gDNA copies per reaction, 42 donors tested positive (1.9%). Among them, 34 carried the common RHDΨ allele (80.9%), while 7 harbored 5 known RHD alleles, and 1 a novel RHD deletion. We inadvertently detected 2 other donors with DVI, establishing a population frequency of 1 in 731 for the U.S.\nA modular approach for RHD screening is suitable for blood donors when sample pooling is not feasible among multiethnic donor populations. We transitioned donors since 2009 from serologic D-negative to molecularly RHD-negative status at the NIH Clinical Center. Molecular RHD screening of serologic D-negative donors is an effective way to identify individuals harboring DEL alleles that can cause alloimmunization in transfusion recipients.",

      "abstract": "Despite the intentional focus of national programs and strategies in last decade, unmarried adolescents and youth (AY) face multiple challenges related to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) information, and access to health and counseling services. With massive urbanization and growing slum and more focus on married youth, the situation and need of unmarried AY are often overlooked. The present study explores the SRH need of AY to gain a holistic understanding of the SRH landscape in the context of slums of Uttar Pradesh, India.\nA formative qualitative study was conducted in the slums of two cities in Uttar Pradesh using qualitative research techniques-in-depth interviews (IDI) and focus group discussions (FGDs) with unmarried adolescents and youths aged 15-24 years. Thematic analysis was guided by principles of grounded theory and narrative inquiry, both inductive and deductive approaches.\nThe study found limited awareness of SRH issues and often inaccurate knowledge of modern contraceptives among the unmarried youth.Gendered access to SRH information emerged clearly, with boys benefitting from wider peer network, while girls relied on familial networks. Lack of social networks and support, communication gap, and limited reach of health providers have majorly contributed to misinformation and misconceptions. Information through social media and online sources served as a key source of SRH knowledge among adolescents and unmarried youth, but concerns remained about the accuracy and reliability of the information accessed. Structural constraints such as stigma, mobility restrictions, and provider bias further marginalized unmarried youth-especially girls-from accessing reliable SRH services.\nThe study highlighted demand for SRH knowledge, source of knowledge, major concerns, and opportunities of AY in urban slums. A clear need for multi-faceted strategies targeting sexual health education, adolescent-responsive SRH services, and expanded digital outreach with verified content for this vulnerable populations are identified. However, targeted intervention through system level approaches for AY can be helpful for dispelling myths and providing accurate information.\nUsing qualitative data from urbanslums of two cities of Uttar Pradesh, this paper explores the limited knowledge about sexual and reproductive health, sources of information, contraceptive use, and engagement with the healthcare system among unmarried youth aged 15–24 years. While traditional norms may disapprove of premarital sex, physical intimacy among unmarried youth is increasing in some parts of India. The major sources of sexual and reproductive health knowledge were peers and sisters-in-laws for boys and girls respectively. However, the social network of boys was wider than that of girls. There is an increasing tide of information through online content in social media, which serves as a key source of knowledge among adolescents, but their accuracy and reliability is questionable. Comprehensive knowledge about contraception is limited, mostly aware of methods such as condoms and pills; however, in-depth knowledge is lacking. Healthcare worker outreach among the unmarried youth was minimal and calls for policy and program intervention.",

However, this population has not been adequately characterized to date, limiting identification of opportunities for intervention.\nWe conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of Medicare beneficiaries who underwent an index emergent or urgent ventral hernia repair between 2011 and 2021. We performed a multivariable risk-adjusted Royston-Parmar survival analysis for cumulative recurrent emergent hernia repair incidence within 10 years, accounting for patient comorbidities, demographics, and repair characteristics. We assessed patient, provider, and community factors associated with an increased risk of recurrent emergent hernia repair. We used the Social Vulnerability Index, a publicly available score from the CDC reflecting 15 sociodemographic factors, to measure social risk.\nAmong 120,227 Medicare beneficiaries who underwent emergent hernia repair during the study period, the mean (SD) age was 71 (12) and 58% were female. At 10 years, the cumulative incidence of recurrent emergent hernia repair was 6.4% (95% CI 6.2-6.7). Median time to recurrent repair was 1.6 years [IQR 0.8-3.2]. Risk-adjusted factors associated with increased risk for recurrent emergent repair include female sex (10-year Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.58, 95% CI [1.24-2.02]), Hispanic ethnicity (10-year HR 1.19, 95% CI [1.01-1.41]), and patients in the highest quintile of social vulnerability (10-year HR 1.33, 95% CI [1.03-1.71]).

      "abstract": "Tertiary students have been recognised as a high-risk population for psychological distress yet, in Australia, have been overlooked in population-level surveillance, health service provision and mental health policy. This study sought to explore trends in self-reported psychological distress and general mental health of tertiary students compared to their non-student working peers in Australia from 2007 to 2022- a timeframe which spans the pre-, mid-, and immediate-post-COVID time periods.\nThe Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey was used as a basis for this study. Focusing on participants aged 18 to 35 from survey waves spanning 2007 to 2022 (average n = 4415 per year), participants were categorised into three groups: working only, tertiary students and working, and tertiary students only. Psychological distress and general mental health were measured using the Kessler-10 scale and the Mental Health Inventory-5, respectively. Weighted regression models compared outcomes between students and non-students.\nPsychological distress and poor mental health have risen among young Australians, with the sharpest increase since 2019. Tertiary students, especially those studying only, showed significantly higher distress and poorer mental health than working peers. Although adjusting for sociodemographic and socioeconomic covariates attenuated the associations, the higher distress levels in students persisted post-2019. Loneliness, long-term disabilities, and poor general health were correlates of poor mental health across all groups.\nFindings highlight the need for targeted care models for tertiary students, including enhanced campus mental health support and screening services, financial support, social connection programs, and digital health solutions.",

      "title": "NRF2 pathway activation predicts poor prognosis in lung cancer: a cautionary note on antioxidant interventions.",
      "abstract": "Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. As an age-related disease, its pathogenesis is shaped by several molecular hallmarks of aging, including impaired DNA repair and diminished stress resilience. The transcription factor NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) is a master regulator of oxidative stress defense and cellular survival. While NRF2 activation is protective in aging tissues, it may also be exploited by cancer cells to promote tumor progression and therapy resistance. This study aims to evaluate whether NRF2 pathway activation predicts clinical outcomes in lung cancer, with potential implications for the use of NRF2-inducing compounds. We analyzed transcriptomic and survival data from 2167 lung cancer patients using the KM Plotter database. A validated 14-gene NRF2 activation signature was used to stratify tumors by NRF2 pathway activity. Associations with overall survival (OS), first progression (FP), and post-progression survival (PPS) were assessed using Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier analysis. High NRF2 signature expression was significantly associated with poorer OS (HR = 1.59, p = 1.3E-9), FP (HR = 1.61, p = 2.6E-5), and PPS (HR = 1.6, p = 0.002). The negative prognostic effect was most pronounced in patients with adenocarcinoma, node-negative disease, and in female patients. These findings highlight the dual role of NRF2 in promoting stress resilience and enabling cancer cell survival. NRF2 activation is a predictor of poor clinical outcomes in lung cancer. Given the widespread use of NRF2-inducing compounds such as resveratrol and sulforaphane, these findings raise important concerns about their safety in individuals at risk for or living with cancer. Our results underscore the importance of context-specific evaluation of NRF2-targeted interventions and caution against the indiscriminate use of NRF2-activating agents in aging populations, particularly in individuals at risk for lung cancer.",

      "title": "Exploring mental health of Italian college students: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
      "abstract": "The transition from adolescence to adulthood is characterized by changes and challenges for students, that can affect their mental well-being. Furthermore, mental disorders often emerge before the age of 24, underscoring the significance of addressing mental health during the college years. The study's objective is to conduct a systematic review of the mental health of Italian university students, exploring the prevalence of psychopathological dimensions, identifying risk and protective factors, and investigating the impact on academic performance.\nThe initial search yielded 842 papers. After the screening process, a total of 27 studies were included (22,928 participants).\nThe prevalence of mental distress is notable: stress affects 72.6%, anxiety 61.8%, depression 41.6%, sleep disorders 63.9%, and suicide risk 6.1%.\nBiological factors like chronic illness and family history increase the risk of psychological disorders. Psychological factors, including sexual orientation, play a role. Dysfunctional personality traits, adverse events, financial concerns, and the pandemic amplify distress. Resilience, coping strategies, peer support, inclusive environments, physical activity, and balanced lifestyles act as protective factors. Mental distress impacts academic performance and often is exacerbated by the pressure to excel. Interventions encompass targeted support, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and the promotion of inclusive and supportive environments.",
